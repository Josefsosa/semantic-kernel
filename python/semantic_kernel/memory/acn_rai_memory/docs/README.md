# ACN RAI Memory Module for Semantic Kernel

## Overview

The ACN RAI (Responsible AI) Memory Module is an advanced memory management system for Semantic Kernel that provides:

- **Observable Behavior Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of agent decisions and behaviors
- **Human-Understandable Explanations**: Natural language explanations of agent decision-making
- **Graph-Based Memory Organization**: Dynamic memory organization using graph structures
- **Data Lineage Integration**: Complete audit trail of data sources and decision paths

## Features

### Core Components

- **RAI Graph**: Dynamic neural graph structure for memory organization
- **Observable Memory**: Behavior tracking and pattern recognition
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Advanced analytics for agent performance
- **Human Understanding**: Natural language explanations and visualizations

### Connectors

- **Neo4j Integration**: Graph database connectivity
- **Vector Store Bridge**: Integration with existing vector databases
- **Lineage Tracker**: Data provenance and audit capabilities

## Quick Start

```python
from semantic_kernel.agents import ChatCompletionAgent
from semantic_kernel.memory.acn_rai_memory import RAIMemoryGraph, ObservableBehavior

# Create an enhanced agent with RAI memory
agent = RAIEnhancedAgent(
    service=AzureChatCompletion(),
    name="RAI-Agent",
    instructions="You are a responsible AI assistant."
)

# The agent now includes observable behavior tracking
# and human-understandable decision explanations
response = await agent.get_response("Explain quantum computing")
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install from source (development)
pip install -e .

# Required dependencies
pip install neo4j networkx matplotlib
```

## Architecture

The ACN RAI Memory Module follows a modular architecture:
